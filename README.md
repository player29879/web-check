## About

_Get info on a websites SSL certs, domain, headers, cookies, DNS records, technologies used, performance, hostnames, crawl rules, server info and more_

#### Screenshot

#### Live Demo
A hosted version can be accessed at: **[web-check.as93.net](https://web-check.as93.net)**

#### Mirror
The source for this repo is mirrored to CodeBerg, available at: **[codeberg.org/alicia/web-check](https://codeberg.org/alicia/web-check)**

#### Motivation
Often when I'm looking into a website, there's several things I always check first.
None of this is hard, and can usually be done with a series of curl commands, or using a combination of online tools.
But it's so much easier to have everything presented clearly and visible in one place.

#### Features
- Server Location
- SSL Info
- Headers
- Associated hostnames
- Domain Whois
- DNS records
- Cookies
- Server info
- Crawl rules
- Performance metrics
- Screenshot
- Tech stack
- Site response times

_Note that not all checks will work for all sites. Sometimes it's not possible to determine some information, and there are limitations imposed by Netlify for the lambda functions._

#### Architecture
It's just a very simple web app (React + TypeScript), with results calculated using a series of Lambda functions. Everything is deployed on Netlify. Most things are done with the native http interface, but there's a few instances where this wasn't possible alone, so is combined with some external APIs, like Shodan for hostnames, IP Info for geolocation, and Google Cloud for performance metrics.
